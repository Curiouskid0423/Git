# Gitlet
#### CS61b Spring 2020 Final Project
<hr>
Implemented my own git, a version control language, with no external backbone code support.
Gitlet support plain files tracking, and remote collaboration, with most of the essential git commands and functionality.
<br>Instructions for using the production version, and development reference will be posted soon, along with a demo GIF :)
